My suggestion is that to add shops and goods to DB we need another part of functionality like an admin page with two forms. 
The first one we'll use to add shops. The second one we will use to add products with the dropdown of choosing a shop. 
But this is not in the scope of these tasks.

1.Download all files from github;

2.Install node.js and webpack;

3.Install all dependencies (npm i);

4.Install PostgreSQL, create a database in the pgAdmin application, import two tables, shops and Products. 
The tables are in the data folder;

5.Open two terminals in the first we write npm run dev and npm run start, in the second npm run server.
